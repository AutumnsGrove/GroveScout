## Personal TODOs (from gym session)

### Completed This Session
- [x] Only finds 1-2 results per search → **FIXED**: Comprehensive search with 20+ retailers, 12 results per query
- [x] Walmart links don't work → **FIXED**: Added `buildProductUrl()` for proper retailer URLs
- [x] No images populated → **FIXED**: Added Brave Image Search integration
- [x] Only calling 1-2 tools → **FIXED**: Now runs 20+ search queries per search
- [x] Switch to DeepSeek v3.2 → **DONE**: DeepSeek provider implemented
- [x] Add Tavily as search option → **DONE**: Tavily integration added
- [x] Proper settings screen → **DONE**: Profile page already has all preferences
- [x] User feedback (thumb up/down) → **DONE**: Added to ProductCard
- [x] Load more searches button → **DONE**: Added to dashboard (5 at a time)
- [x] BYOK options → **DONE**: DB migration ready, API key table created

### Still TODO
- [ ] Live streaming results as search runs
- [ ] Enable Cloudflare Durable Objects for advanced search
    - SvelteKit's adapter-cloudflare doesn't support exporting DO classes from the generated worker
    - Options: (1) Separate worker for DOs, (2) wrangler multi-worker config, (3) custom entry point
    - See `wrangler.toml` - DO config is commented out until resolved
- [ ] Proper filters on search page
- [ ] Reference project on GroveEngine readme
- [x] D1 → R2 auto-migration (after 7 days, markdown files) → **DONE**: Migration scheduler + R2 storage implemented
- [x] Tavily search provider selector → **DONE**: UI toggle between Brave and Tavily
- [ ] Pass feedback to new search runs for personalization

## Manual Commands (Post-Merge)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations

**Feedback + BYOK tables (0005):**
```bash
# Local
wrangler d1 execute scout-db --file=./migrations/0005_feedback.sql --local

# Production
wrangler d1 execute scout-db --file=./migrations/0005_feedback.sql
```

**R2 Migration support (0006):**
```bash
# Local
wrangler d1 execute scout-db --file=./migrations/0006_r2_migration.sql --local

# Production
wrangler d1 execute scout-db --file=./migrations/0006_r2_migration.sql
```

### 3. Create R2 Bucket
```bash
# Create the R2 bucket for long-term result storage
wrangler r2 bucket create scout-results
```

### 4. Add New API Keys (when ready)

**DeepSeek API Key:**
```bash
wrangler secret put DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
# Enter your key when prompted
```

**Tavily API Key:**
```bash
wrangler secret put TAVILY_API_KEY
# Enter your key when prompted
```

### 5. Enable BYOK in Config
After adding user keys to the database, update `src/lib/server/agents/config.ts`:
```ts
providers: {
  useDeepSeekForText: true,  // Enable when ready
  useTavily: true,           // Enable when ready
}
```

### 6. Deploy
```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

## Open Questions (Block V1) - ANSWERED
1. Multi-domain credit calculation - flat rate per search? → **flat rate**
2. Image sourcing - Brave Image Search or accept missing images? → **accept missing but prefer images, integrated Brave Image Search + Tavily**
3. Beta launch strategy - invite-only vs public? → **invite only, free users get 5 lower-quality searches**

## Post‑Review Actions (2025‑12‑08)

A comprehensive review of the latest commits has been completed. The following actions are recommended before deployment:

### ✅ Completed
- Applied all database migrations locally (0001–0006).
- Verified all 96 tests pass.
- Created deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`).

### ⚠️ Required Before Deployment
1. **Fix Cloudflare configuration warning** by adding `durable_objects` and `migrations` under `[env.production]` in `wrangler.toml`.
2. **Set missing secrets** (Apple OAuth, DeepSeek, Tavily, etc.) using `wrangler secret put`.
3. **Apply remote migrations** with `wrangler d1 execute scout-db --remote`.
4. **Deploy** using `pnpm run deploy`.

### 📋 Detailed Commands
See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for exact commands and step‑by‑step instructions.
